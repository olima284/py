Exp:
#You realize that the numbers don’t divide evenly and you don’t want to throw out the remaining cucumbers.
Create a variable called float_cucumbers_per_person that holds the float result of dividing cucumbers by num_people.
Print float_cucumbers_per_person to the console.
>>>
cucumbers = 100
num_people = 6
whole_cucumbers_per_person = 100/6
print(whole_cucumbers_per_person)

float_cucumbers_per_person =float(100)/6
print(float_cucumbers_per_person)

arithmetic operations, each assigned to a variable
mirthful_addition = 12381 + 91817
amazing_subtraction = 981 - 312
trippy_multiplication = 38 * 902
happy_division = 540 / 45
sassy_combinations = 129 * 1345 + 120 / 6 - 12

( Integer ) Is a Whole Number
>>> int1 = 1

Number With a Decimal point is called a( Float )
>>> float1 = 1.0
@uotient1 = float(7)/2
# the value of quotient1 is 3.5quotient1 = 7./2
# the value of quotient1 is 3.5




You can also define a float using scientific notation, with e indicating the power of 10:
>>>>>>>>># this evaluates to 150:
float4 = 1.5e2




MULTIPLE LINE STINGS:

# If we want a string to span multiple lines,
 we can also use triple quotes:
address_string = """136 Whowho Rd
Apt 7
Whosville, WZ 44494"""

BOOLEANS:
A boolean is actually a special case of an integer.
A value of True corresponds to an integer value of 1, and will behave the same.
A value of False corresponds to an integer value of 0

CONVERT Variables To Different Datatypes

Use an integer as part of a string
Use: "str():"
EXP:
age = 13
print "I am " + str(age) + " years old!"

>>>PRINT->>> "I am 13 years old!"

Perform arithmetic operations ON A STRING VALUE
USE: "int():"
number1 = "100"
number2 = "10"

string_addition = number1 + number2
#string_addition now has a value of
>>>PRINT>>>10010


int_addition = int(number1) + int(number2)
#int_addition has a value of
>>>PRINT>>>110



EXP
float_1 = 0.25
float_2 = 40.0

product = float(float_1) * float(float_2)

big_string = "The product was " + str(int (product))
print(big_string)
prints >>>>The product was 10

Create a variable called product that contains the result of multiplying the float value of float_1 and float_2.

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Create a string called big_string that says:

The product was X
